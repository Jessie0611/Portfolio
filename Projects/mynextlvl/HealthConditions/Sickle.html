                <div class="pBox"><p>Sickle Cell Disease is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders that is present from birth. Healthy red blood cells are round and move easily through small blood vessels to carry oxygen throughout the body. However, in someone who has sickel cell disease, the red blood cells become hard and sticky, and have a C-shape, like a farmer's sickle. The sickle cells die early, which casues a constant shortage of red blood cells called anemmia.</p></div>
